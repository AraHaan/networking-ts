\rSec0[plans]{Future plans (Informative)}

\pnum
This section describes tentative plans for future versions of this technical
specification and plans for moving content into future versions of the \Cpp
Standard.

\pnum
The \Cpp committee may release new versions of this technical specification,
containing networking library extensions we hope to add to a near-future
version of the \Cpp Standard. Future versions will define their contents
in \tcode{std::experimental::net::v2}, \tcode{std::experimental::net::v3},
etc., with the most recent implemented version inlined into
\tcode{std::experimental::net}.

\pnum
When an extension defined in this or a future version of this technical
specification represents enough existing practice, it will be moved into
the next version of the \Cpp Standard by replacing the
\tcode{experimental::net::vN} segment of its namespace with \tcode{net},
and by removing the \tcode{experimental/} prefix from its header's path.
